LIVE SAVING NOTE!:
make sure to add device creation (like linking a file to a device so more than one device per a file)
make sure you add a close function to the vfs so I can clean up device pointers!
implement those extra actions on tcsetattr

In a world where technology is constantly following us around I believe that the biggest factor facing todays teens is proper time management. The Pew Research Center has shown that 4 in 10 teens believe they spend too much time on their phone. Sadly though it is not solely mobile devices eating away at teens time. 55% of teenagers in a poll found procrasantion and poor time mangement to be sources of stress during the school year. In additon 81% of students have addmitted they multitask during there homework. I belive that because of simple accsess to technolagy many students suffer from a poor concept of time and how much they could really acomplish.

The root of this issue is not the fact that that students are relaxing or entertaining themselves instead it is the constant battle that students face between taking time to relax and taking time to complete more productive tasks. Many students having trouble with this choice end up in an  in between zone where they are attempting to both at once. In fact 52% of highschoorers belive they need more time to relax. The issue is that students are attemping to mix there relaxation time with their acidemic time. Decreasing the effincy of both.
